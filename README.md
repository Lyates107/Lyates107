**Hi, Iâ€™m @Lyates107** ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent graduate from The University of South Florida with a bachelors degree in computer science. I enjoy programming in mostly C++ and C. Recently I have worked on a few projects using microcontrollers and writing in Assembly. I'm currently learning C# and Java, and trying to get better using linuxOS.
